Quiana Tenise Smith

About me:
Welcome, welcome! My name is Quiana! 
I recently completed an intensive coding boot camp, where I acquired a full-stack development experience. I started off studying fine arts and I loved it. In the way of life, I deviated from art and began a career in finanace. Surprisingly, I excelled in the field, and learned many things. Also in the way of life, I reached a soul searching point in career and realized that I wanted to get back to my roots. Art. I was introduced to programming by a friend, and had an ah-ha moment. I saw that I would be able to couple my art with the ever growing IT field.
