Farzana: Q your picture is amazing- i don't know how else to say it! anyways, i like the simplicity of your project. All the links are working. A good layout of the work you did. Good luck!

Michael: That is a stunning headshot, and I love how you attached a link to the image (git and Linkedin). 

Jamie: I love your background info and the story about why you started coding :) You got all the content up there, but maybe you can add some more colors to make everything pop? Good job!  P.S. your background image on LinkedIn is AMAZING!
